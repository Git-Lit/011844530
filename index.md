  THE CONCILIATORY POLICY WITH ITS RESULT.


The Province of Khandesh under the new system was divided into
threeagencies, which were apportioned lo as many Officers, who were expected to
reside within the limits of their respective districts.


Nundoorl.ar, Sooltanpoor and Pimpulnair with all the independent and
tributary chieftains, including those of the Daung, formed the North Western
Agency.


Jamnair, Burgaon and Chaleesgaon comprehending the districts below
and adjoiningthe Ajunta and Saatmulla range fell to the share of the Southern •_
and the North Eastern agency extended along the Saat-poora range including
the districts of Chopra, Yawut and Sowda, to which were afterwards added
the centre divisions of Errindole, Amulnair, and Nusserabad. To the
Officer in charge of the last mentioned agency the duty was likewise
entrusted of raising a Bheel corps under active Native and non-Cominissioned
Officers from the Line, and the following instructions which were issued may
be justly considered as tbe ground work <>_ the reformation.


The Agents were to preserve the peace of the country, to ameliorate the
condition ot the Bheels and to retain a watchful superintendence over the
range committed to their charge, and while endeavouring to inspire the
wild men with confidence in the Government, to encourage their
attentions towards industrious pursuits; to redress all complaints, and to
be careful that those on whom pensions had been conferred were duly paid'.
It was also the duty of the Agents to act as arbitrators, when the parties
mutually agreed, to apprehend offenders, and to commit for trial, or otherwise
to inflict such punishment as might be customary among the tribe; and to
superintend all such military operations as might be considered necessary to
reduce gangs who still continued to commit depredations.


The Bheels were to be registered and called upon to render an account of
the manner in which they obtained their livelihood; waste lands were to be
allotted to all who were willing to form themselves, under certain restrictions,
into colonies; they were to be restricted from congregating in masses,
prevented from quitting, without intimation, their places of abode, and strictly checked
from assembling in " Hutties" among the hills on any pretence whatever.


Security was to be taken from those against whom strong suspicion was
entertained, rewards of free-rent land, of animals and implements of husbandry
were sanctioned for meritorious conduct in aiding the Police or for
remarkable industry in cultivation, and the Patels of Villages were also to be
encouraged by the presentation of honorary dresses to assist in promoting the
desired object, by forwarding to the Agents correct returns of all the Bheels
within their range, of the mode by which they subsisted, and of the adequacy
or otherwise, of the provision allotted by the State for their maintenance. A
general superintendence of the Bheels and the petty Chiefs was required, and
the dues payable to the former in Villages were to be strictly enforced •
Punchayets were in some instances allowed to inflict punishment under
authority of the Agent, but imprisonment was ordered to be avoided as
attended with little inconvenience to the delinquent, but with great misery to
those who depended upon him for support; besides, the Bheel considering it
no disgrace whatever, returned to his home from a residence in the jail, in do
ways subdued in disposition and considerably deteriorated in morals.
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 11 -->

The village Police now alone remained to be extricated from the mass of
disorder, into which every measure regardiug the Bheel system had been
formerly plunged, so as to allow every chance to the healthy operation of the
new reform. When wielded in the hands of a powerful Government, the
system of Bheel Police had been found to perform the most efficient duty, but
when the curb of restraint was removed, the most glaring abuses and flagrant
crimes were speedily induced; under the name and shelter of the Jogla
watchmen, the Bheel plunderer remained unmolested within the precincts of the
village, and few of the Native functionaries could resist the easy acquisition of
property by a share of thespoil which was so readily awarded for the protection.


A strict enquiry was therefore absolutely necessary, when the amount of
Hucks in each separate village, together with the number of persons required
for the performance of its duties were correctly ascertained, the requisite quota
was placed in charge, the surplus drafted to the Colonies, and the regular
paynient of these dues, which when neglected, was attended with such evil,
was strictly enforced by personal superintendence.


The amount of rent-free land, was also fairly fixed, according to the size and
revenue of the village, and for a share of the produce, this land being
cultivated by the Patel, a bond of good feeling was thus mutually established
between the parties, the Bheel was left at liberty to attend to the numerous
and important avocations of his office, for the due performance of which
every hour was necessary, and the duties of the Patel and the Tagla being
intimately connected, if the former functionary retained a proper interest in
the security of the inhabitants and a vigilant watch over the conduct of
the Tagla, their combined knowledge and assistance could, in all cases of
crime, be rendered of the most material service.


By this settlement, a sure remedy was provided for the former heavy evils,
by ensuring an honest subsistence to all the Taglas who were found in the
village, and who instead of being the scourges ot" the country were now
converted into active and useful members ot Police, whilst those who took to the
plough, gradually, like their brethren in the Colonies, became quiet and
obedient cultivators.


After a lapse of three years, the remnant of the predatory Bheels in the
Saatmulla and Ajunta range who had been so long carrying on depredations
on the Eastern frontier, were brought to terms, and the system was fairly
established in the Southern parts of the Province.


A register of all the Bheels had been framed, a Kowl was in the possession
of every individual, the hucks of Naicks and Taglas had been enquired into
and adjusted, the Native functionaries were required to see the dues properly
paid, and the Bheels ventured not to leave their villages without permission
from the Patel.


A Darogha Carkoon was employed in each Talooka, constantly moving
from village to village to see that orders were attended to, and that the
Bheels were present and busy with their ploughs; a Darogha Sebundee was
stationed in each Colony to superintend and overlook its proceedings, and
the Agent continually moved through his districts, to ensure, by his personal
inspection, the effect of his orders.


The result of his reticulated settlement was shortly manifested, and these
districts formerly the scene of every outrage, where neither life nor property
were secure, now enjoyed tranquillity; the roads formerly hazardous for the
armed party, were traversed at all hours by single passengers, the formidable
list of crimes had dwindled down to the report of a few petty thefts, and the
Bheels from outcasts had become members of the society, daily rising in
respectability and appearance, and becoming useful and obedient servants of
the State.

flaming fire, when roused by the effects of ardent spirit; and led in large
bodies by numerous leaders, they were for years a scourge to all around.
Ten thousand of the Guicowar's troops sent for the purpose of their coercion
were defeated and driven with disgrace from their fastnesses, and it remained
for their reformed brethren in Khandesh under their European leaders, to
overrun their tangled forest, to seize all their potent leaders, and to reduce the
race for the first time to a state of entire and unconditional subjection.

During the struggle between the Mahomedans and the Mahrattas, the
excesses of the Bheels arose to a great height, yet it may be said that
Khandesh was in a flourishing condition up to the year 1798, when Bajee l.ao
succeeded on the death of Nana Furnavese to his free exercise of authority as
Peishwa, but the successful rebellion of Yeshwant Row Holkar which
shortly afterwards broke out, proved to be the commencement of the manifold
miseries and misfortunes of this Province, which during a period of two years
was on three occasions sacked and devastated by the marauding troops; and
the scourge of war was in 1803 succeeded by a most unusual and withering
famine which extended from the Saat-poora hills to the city of Hyderabad.
Under this calamity the country became for a time deserted, many cultivators
fled to Berar and Guzerat, the greater portion of the Bheel population
abandoned the plains and returned not again, and now commenced the Bundumul,
that period of utter anarchy and confusion, which so long reigned throughout
this unhappy land. Organized gangs started up in every direction, and the
mountain ridges were quickly studded with Hutties, from the tiny hamlet of
the freebooter, to the grand encampments of the powerful naicks, who,
assuming the state of petty princes, despatched their armies of a thousand men to
sack and lay waste the surrounding country.


On the occupation of the Province of Khandesh by the British
Government in 1818, anarchy and lawless oppression had reached a fearful height,
and murder and rapine stalked openly and unrestrainedly through the land.
Fifty notorious leaders infested this once flourishing "Garden of the west," and
their every command was implicitly obeyed by upwards of five thousand
ruthless followers whose sole occupation was pillage and robbery, whose delight,
alone consisted in the murderous foray, and whose subsistence depended
entirely on the fruits of their unlawful spoil. Smarting also under the
repeatedly broken pledges of the former Native Government, and rendered savage
from the wholesale slaughter of their families and relations, the Bheels were
more than usually suspicious of a new Government of foreigners, and less than
ever inclined to submit to the bonds of order and restraint.


From Kokurmonda to Booranpoor the whole range of the Saat-poora
mountains teemed with the disaffected. The Saatmulla and Ajunta Kneels
under thirty-two leaders were in arms in numerous parties, carrying fire and
sword over the Southern parts of the province, and the petty Rajahs of Peint
and Abhona having united with the powerful Naick, Govinda, the work of
desolation was urged with a bloody hand through the entire range of the
Western Ghauts. The roads were impassable, villages in every direction were
plundered and murders daily committed, cattle and hostages were driven oft"
from the very centre of the province, aud the excesses rose to such a height,
that the Ryots refused to receive Tuccavee, whilst their property was thus
utterly insecure.

The first plan adopted by Colonel Briggs on the occupation of the
province of Khandesh by the British Government, was to stop the supplies of food
which were chiefly drawn from the plains, to cut off any parties of Bheels that
attempted to issue for plunder, and to make vigorous attacks on the points
within the hills to which the chiefs had retired.


During the second year of British Administration, many of the Chiefs by
the prompt decision and the praiseworthy efforts of the British Troops, were
either seized or killed in battle; but these chiefs were in most cases succeeded

picion, the system of liberality and forbearance observed by the British
Government, and naturally suspected the recurrence of former treachery; but
strenuous endeavours successfully convinced them of the utter groundlessness
of their fears and the folly of their former conduct, and by working on the
better feelings of the race, the knowledge began to gain ground, that the
Government not only possessed the means of restaining their future
depredations, but also entertained an ardent wish to promote their benefit and
welfare.


The success of these exertions shortly became manifest, and numbers of the
tribe having availed themselves of the proffered terms, settled quietly in
different locations; and supplied by the Agent with food and implements of
husbandry, they gradually abandoned their scruples in regard to labour, while
each succeeding day increased their confidence in the promises of
Government, and as the more fiery and turbulent were periodically drafted to the
new corps, the little colonies were allowed to remain in peace and quietude,
unagitated by the unruly designer whose word had formerly stirred up the
dullest spirits to ferocious deeds.


The novel and arduous undertaking of raising a corps from these predatory
tribes had been already commenced, and Captain Outram, who was at the
time serving with the Military detachments acting against the Bheels, seized
every opportunity in his power to hold intercourse with this rude and savage
people. Living unattended for weeks together amongst their "Hutties" by
the fearless and manly confidence which he evinced in their honor and good
faith by so unhesitatingly entrusting his life to their keeping, he succeeded in
inspiring them with a conviction that the British Government was sincere iu
its professions of hating their interests and welfare deeply at heart.


Indulging the wild men with feasts and entertainments and delighting all by
his matchless urbanity, Captain Outram at length contrived to draw over to
the cause nine recruits, one of whom was a most notorious plunderer, and had
a short time before successfully robbed the Officer Commanding the
Detachment which had been sent against him. This infant corps soon became
strongly attached to the person of their new Chief aud entirely devoted to his
wishes, their good wdl had been won by his kind and conciliatory manners,
while their admiration and respect had been thoroughly roused and excited
by his prowess and valour in the chase.


By means of these nine recruits Captain Outram was enabled to attract
others to his standard, and on the conclusion of the Monsoon he left the
Head Quarters of Dhurrungaon at the head of sixty men, armed with bows
and arrows, and marching round the province, successfully recruited in every
district, A draft of forty regulars from the Line was received to act as driil
masters and Officers, but the Bheels appearing suspicious of this arrangement
their muskets and belts were for the time laid aside, and confidence was only
regained by the assurance that all were to be alike in appearance and duties
and that when properly sensible of the utility of the measure they should be
all alike aimed in the European manner.


The reception of these wild recruits by the 23rd Regiment Bombay Native
Infantry in the Camp of Malligaum, was greatly conducive to the good cause
men of the highest caste behaved in a manner most flattering to the feelinos
of the mountaineers, visiting them, and presenting them with betelnut to the
no small amazement of the guests and to the gratification of Government who
complimented the Regiment on their conduct.


While however the work progressed thus favourably, it was at the same
time evident that extreme difficulties had yet to be encountered; inveterate
habits were not to be changed in a day, and in addition to the
natural repugnance to restraint and subjection to law, strange rumours
and reports were afloat throughout the province, regarding the intention

  THE BHEELS OF KHANDESH UNTIL THECOMMENCEMENT OF THE AMELIORATION SYSTEM IN 1825.


The Province of Khandesh is an extensive fertile and well watered plain
■of about thirteen thousand square miles in extent, and interspersed with
ranges of low barren hills, at the base of which run
nume*A map of the pro- rous rivers and rivulets flowing from the table land into
the river Taptee.* This province is nearly surrounded by
broad chains of mountains whose sides are clothed in noxious vegetation,
where for many months of the year, none but the hardy denizen of the hill
can exist, and where secure in the unwholesome fastnesses of these more
elevated regions, the Cateran could undisturbedly collect his wild force and
burst from the bosora of the mist upon the unsuspecting prey on the plain.


The tabular trap hills of the Saat-pooras which form the Northern
boundary of the province, are separated from each other by ravines of vast
magnitude, and are covered with splendid forests which afford amidst the most
romantic scenery, unbounded shelter to the outlaw. On the West the great
Siiklit.ni range rises steep and stony; these Ghauts however are not broken but
sustain tangled masses of Bamboo, which is found nowhere else in greater
luxuriance or more difficult of access, whilst the continuous ranges of'Chandore,
Saatmulla and Ajunta, bound the province to the South, and the thick
Bauble jungle which shrouds their thousand dark dells, presents equal difficulties
to the pursuit of the offender, as do the low sterile hillocks which to the
Eastward separate Khandesh from the rich plains of Berar.


The roads also until a late period were ill appointed and deficient in every
thing but discomfort and danger; few and far between were the miserable
hamlets, and the passes through the mountains were rugged and
impracticable as their fierce possessors. The decline of this rich province from
the flourishing condition which it had obtained under its Mahomedan masters,
is to be dated from the year 1802, when it was ravaged by Holkar's Army.
This blow was followed by a famine in 1803, and its ruin was subsequently
consummated by the rapacity and misgovernment of the Peishwa's
Officers. The Bheels who had heretofore mixed with the other inhabitants, and
had, as village Watchmen, been the great instruments of Police throughout
Khandesh, being re.luced to a state of starving desperation, withdrew to the
surrounding mountains. The Pindarrees meanwhile annually ravaged the
open country, various insurgents plundered at the head of bodies of horse, and
parties of Arabs establishing themselves in the numerous fastnesses and forts,
laid all the neighbourhood under heavy contribution. The expulsion of
the Arabs was a natural consequence of the war, and the bodies of plundering
horsemen were unable to keep the field, but the settlement of the Bheels
proved to be an undertaking of much greater difficulty.

  Strength of Detachments of the Bheel Corps in September 1843.


Up to September 1843, 1800 Bheels had been passed through the ranks of
the Corps to their entire civilization, the discharged members dwell quietly at
their respective villages as Wuttundars, Cultivators or Jaglas, and the sums of
money ns Tuecavee iiivcn at, various times to relation* on the responsibility of
of the Corps have been all scrupulously repaid by the Bheel Sepoy.

The overage nnmbet of Scholars who daily attend the Bheel School at
Head Quarters, is about 30.

  Strength of the Khanclesh Bheel Corps in September 1843.


The pioportion of duty required from a Regiment of the line is one-third
of its strength.

The Beel Corps performs duties for which upwards of three-fourths of its
entire strength are required.

Only two European Officers are allowed, whilst the numerous outposts
scattered over a large province, require continual personal inspection, and cannot
possibly be relieved under a term of 6 or 7 years.

Troops of the Line are relieved after 3 months.

and power is supreme over every family of Khandesh Bheels whose
relations and connexions form its component members, and thus by a wild
levy of only eight hundred men, the internal duties of a province, one-third
the size of England, have been well and faithfully performed.


As an item of economy the reduction of an entire locsd corps, a portion
of the Auxiliary horse, and a large body of Peons, whose services were in
consequence no longer required, together with the abolition of two* heavily paid
appointments, the duties of which have been added to those of its
Commandant, have more than covered the expense of the corps. One Regiment of
the line has also been entirely withdrawn from the province, while the health
of the remaining troops is carefully preserved, f


The hitherto untameable Bheel banditti cannot now as formerly unite in
general insurrection, without punishment, few individuals who offend against
the laws can elude the arm of justice, and by thus wisely employing a small
portion of the community a numerous race is kept in subjection, the
tranquillity of this immense province is satisfactorily obtained, which no military
force nor expenditure of treasure could have otherwise effected, the physical
condition of the people has improved from the cessation of trouble and the
suppression of feudal enormity, and the blessings of thousands of happy and
reformed beings daily rise as a grateful offering to a munificent Government
who have thus shed so bright an influence over their destiny.

t Whilst in charge of the unhealthy posts of Khandesh now occupied by the Bheel Corps,
at the close of the usual tour ol three years, every Regiment of the line, without taking into
account casualties, was forced to discharge to their homes upwards of a hundred men as unfit
for further service, whilst a like number entirely disabled swelled the list of Government
pensioners.

which have lapsed from death
or other accident, but the reformation of the tribe from their savage and
turbulent habits has proved a blessing and a benefit to the country, for which
no pecuniary sacrifice could be too great.


The future prospects held out by the effVct of this enlightened and
generous policy, are also not less cheering; principles are now recognized, and
agencies brought into play, which inevitably progress to future stability, the
increased ease of circumstance and comfort lead to a prolongation of human
life, and the effect of liberal laws, will gradually tend to melt the separate
drop into the general mass.


At present the land of Bheel location * is cultivated as a free gift from
Government, hereafter, as education raises this race of men from the low and
barbarous rank it held among our native subjects, an addition may accrue to
the revenue, and an accession of sturdy cultivators, from the huts of this
prolific tribe to fill up those blanks caused by the sweeping scourges which
too often desolate the province, but these are secondary objects, when
compared to the one so wonderfully and successfully gained, which has secured
to the country a state of quiet and repose, unknown to it for nearly half a
century.


The Bheel now feels a relish for that industry which renders subsistence secure,
and life peaceful and comfortable, he unites with the Ryot in the cultivation of
those fields, which he once ravaged and laid waste, and protects the village,
the traveller and the property of Government, which were formerly the
objects of his spoliation; the extensive wilds which heretofore afforded him
cover during his bloody expedi ions, are now smiling with fruitful crops; and
population, industry and opulence are progressing throughout the land.

The reform has been steadily pursued with equal success to the present f

of the rising generation, and the present youth
inured to labour and sobered by instruction, have lost the recollection of the state
of older times, when, from their insulated position, the tribe alone retorted
hatred and vengeance upon their oppressors; the requisite number of ploughs
have been long since established for the maintenance of the numerous Colonies
which are scattered over the southern districts, and although, the strain be
somewhat too tight for the bow, and the duties exacted be too numerous for
the strength of the Bheel corps, such as indeed could not be with justice
performed by almost two Regiments of the Line, still there exist few instances of
grumbling or infidelity

The men have been always successfully employed and have proved equally
staunch and faithful on the unhealthy outpost, and among the intricate defiles
of the mountain range, daring alike the insidious fever and the arms of the
enemy; they have ever proved superior to the difficulty, the fastnesses have been
penetrated and cleared on every side of the province, internal and external
disturbance have been through their exertions entirely quelled, and led by
their Officers, they have acted with success against every marauding tribe
in the vicinity of Khandesh, and have been employed with equal credit to
themselves against their turbulent brethren in Guzerat. The district treasuries
are now under their charge, the chief police rests in their hands, their influence

by others equally powerful and ferocious with themselves, and beyond the
immediate influence of the British troops, there was little protection for life
and property in Khandesh. Proclamations were in vain issued that former
ciitnes would be forgotten and that in future those Bheels who returned to
the plains should be fed at the expense of the village; the amnesty was
unheeded and rejected and not one of the tribe repaired to take advantage of the
liberal offer.


No regular police existed at this time; the Bheels who formerly had been
the village watchmen were in arms against the State, and reports daily arrived
of robberies, murders and house-breakings, upwards of one huudred
complaints of this nature being made during the course of one month, from the
single district of Nundoorbar. An Irregular Corps of Turree Bheels was at
length attempted on the principle of confirming the hereditary Naicks as the
superiors of the Legion, but the experiment entirely failed, the men being
constantly in a state of intoxication, and their grovelling habits proving
incapable of restraint by Native Officers who were equally licentious with
themselves, this body was ultimately disbanded as totally useless.


Amonst the many plans which were agitated to restore peace to the
province, Colonel Briggs the Political Agent, proposed to pension every
marauding Bheel in Khandesh on a monthly allowance of two Rupees together
with a certain quantity of grain; military operations were however finally
resorted to, and parties of Sebundees and regular troops were despatched to
protect the Passes, but they were shortly obliged to quit, leaving two-thirds of
their number victims to the malaria, and the charge of these important outlets
was again handed over to the loose control of the hereditary Naicks on double
their former allowance, but with no happier effects than before.


During the four succeeding years the same successive arrangements were
pursued with equally unsuccessful results; conciliatory measures were first
adopted, settlements of the most liberal nature were entered into with many,
and these entirely failing, recourse was had to arms, which only for a time,
and in the immediate neighbourhood of the force, had the temporary effect of
apparently subduing these untameable spirits.


A new era in the history of this province was however about to commence;
the physical condition of the Bheels was to undergo a thorough and
wholesome reformation; banishment, imprisonment, the lash and the gibbet were to
be abolished, and the gentle hand and the persuasive word of a mild and
paternal Government were to lead the hitherto wild man within the pale of
civilized life, and to unfold to him the blessings of peace and good order.


This is not a fitting place to comment on the conduct of the local Officers
who were employed to introduce these ble.-sin_s. or otherwise much might be
said in praise of all; but credit is especially due to Colonel Archibald
Robertson, under whose auspices this new policy commenced, whose talents
were equally conspicuous with the liberality of his sentiments; and to the
zeal, ability and fearless energy, which on e\ery occasion were displayed by
the Agents, Captain Outran) and Majo. Ovans, must be mainly attributed
the much desired result which followed the conciliatory line of policy so ably
carried out by those Officers.

  Synopsis of Bheel settlement in Khandesh from 1818 to 1843.  
  
  
  1818.

The first settlement was during this year attempted by Colonel Bri°^s the

Political Agent in Khandesh.
Detachments marched to the Saat-poora hills against Gunga Naik and

Ramjee.
The following Naicks and feudal Superiors come in, receiving pensions from

Government, and assuming the responsibility of the peace of their
neigh
bourhood.
Goomania, 200 Rupees per annum in addition to his hucks.

The Aranuddy Naicks collectively, Rupees 3,000.
Feghy Khan. Rupees '.,200, and the Village of Kanapoor.
Jewa Wassawa, Rupees 3,0o0, with 10 Horse and 40 foot.
The Boodawul Rana, Rupees 1,000.
Dewjee Naick, 6| Rupees per mensem, and the Village of Chicklee.
Ramjee and Oochit, Rupees 500.
Khylia and Cundoo, each Rupees 200.
Goomania though accepting the terms, never personally visited the
Poli
tical Agent.
Gunga Naick of Chopra, having attacked a detachment of Regulars was

killed in the fight.
An unsuccessful attempt made to employ the Turvee Bheels as a
Po
lice corps.
Detachments moved against Kania Turvee.
Dusrut sacks and destroys a village,
Mullarjee Deshmook attacks Soorungana.
The Aranuddy Naicks return their pensions and the money they have
re
ceived, declaring they will collect for themselves.
The Thalnair purgunna plundered by the hill Bheels.
Kanyia's huttee burnt by Major McBean.
A village in the very central district of Khandesh plundered and burnt.
Ramjee, Oochit and Soobhania, ravaging Nundoorbar and Sooltanpoor,

Colonel Jardine's force is marched against them.  
  
  
  1819.

The pension arrangement, providing for the chiefs and a few followers, no

doubt reduced the strength of the gang, fewer villages were attacked,

but the number of murders, robberies and house breaking was by no

means reduced. Expeditions sent against Kania Dusrut, and Koor
Wus
sawa in the Saat-poora and against Chiel Naick in the Saatmullar range;

chief apprehended and hanged. The whole province a scene of utter

confusion, the village Police aiding the plunderers and the devastation

carried on with impunity.
Raising a Bheel corps under consideration, but the Political Agent reports

the Bheels as unfit for Sepoys, recommends that all Bheels in the
pro
vince receive two Rupees per mensem. Both plans negatived, Sebundies

and regular troops sent to garrison the Passes, but are withdrawn disabled

by the climate, and Goomany and the other Naicks re-established on

double allowance.

The Koal of Kurroond placed at the head of Sebundies to keep the road

from to Thalnair.

Chumar Wulvej, and 50 of his clan killed by the Guicowar Bheels, and

Koor Wussawa tenders his submission; Luximon Parvee taken and
par
doned. Troops still out among the Saat-poora.

Boorhah Khan, and Meer Khan come in and receive pensions of 12 and

8 Rupees per mensem.

From remote ages, the Bheels have been recognised as a distinct people,
and in a Sanscrit Vocabulary about seven hundred years old, the term "Bheel,'
is used to denote a peculiar race of barbarians, subsisting chiefly on plunder,
and found more particularly on the mountainous tract along the Nerbudda;
still earlier mention of this race is made in the celebrated Hindoo poem of
the Mahabhurat, where the Bheels are minutely described, and a long and
fabulous account is there given of their origin; but although frequently
noticed in the Mahomedan histories of Malwa and Guzerat, as a powerful
nation, inhabiting the mountains and forests of Meywar and Oodipoor, having
independent Chiefs and Rajahs, and holding their own Courts and Durbars,
yet the most ancient records of Khandesh merely allude to the residence of
the tribe in small numbers on the Northern boundary of the province, which
may indeed be considered as a spur from the vast mountainous tract then
possessed by the nation.


The Bheels being driven by other tribes from Meywar and Joudpoor
settled amongst the rocky ranges of the Saat-poora, the Vindhya and the
Saatmulla, and amidst the woody banks of the Mhye, the Nerbudda and the
Taptee, where, protected by the strong nature of the country, they have
since dwelt, subsisting partly on their own industry, but more generally on the
plunder of the rich land-holders in their vicinity, considering depredation on
the inhabitants of the plain as a sort of privilege, and a tax upon all
persons passing through the country of their occupation as a national ri^ht.


The bulk of the Bheel population in Khandesh, which is estimated at one
eighth of the entire inhabitants of the province, is chiefly settled in Bauglan
and to the North and Northwest, where they in general reside peaceably as
patels, cultivators and proprietors of the soil. In this portion of the province
they are not so degraded, because they are not so completely destitute of all
those claims that usually command consideration; they are not so exposed to
want nor so enured to hardships, and therefore neither so reckless of their
own or the lives of others, and possessing landed property, obligations as
proprietors are imposed : the respect of others necessarily induces a certain degree
of self respect, and in proportion as these essentials are present or absent the
Bheels are more or less civilized and inclined to live in peace and quietness.
The most restless and troublesome are those dwelling immediately at the
foot and amidst the recesses of the surrounding ranges, who at different
periods have either usurped or have been entrusted with all the Passes leading
into the country, and till lately have held charge of many of the most
important fortresses in the plains.


Their hivelike habitations, formerly crested the top of each isolated bill,
where approach from every side was easily defended or immediately
discovered, and these hovels not reared for permanent occupation but hastily put
together to be crept into for a few months or weeks, were without regret
abandoned on any occasion that induced the occupants to shift their quarters.
Roving and restless by disposition, and skilful hunters by necessity, the
woods and jungles supplied them with roots, berries and game; a successful
stray filled their stores to overflowing, and as every man's hand was lifted
against them, so the measure of wrath was fully returned by the tribe, whose
powers of mischief far exceeded those of their numerous oppressors, and
whose habits and locations enabled them to bid such a lengthy defiance to so
many governments.


The more civilized generally apply the term Bheel to all who lead a
lawless life, and who reside in a remote junjily country, but the name is given
to many who do not acknowledge it, and the following are the only clans
in Khandesh who deserve the appellation.


The "Turrees" who embraced the Mahomedan faith during the reign of
Aitrungzebe, and who inhabit the country to the Northeast of the province
from Arrawud to Boorhanpoor; they are a fine race of men, and abhorring

lowers which in earlier times was little more then a chain of slavery and the
permanence of evil, in its better modification, became the bond of fellow
feeling and good order.


At the close of the monsoon of 1827, this newly raised corps was reviewed
by the Brigadier of the district, whose high commendation, after four days
exercise, for dress and steady performance of intricate manœuvres appeared in
the General Orders of the armv. It indeed seemed extraordinary to every
one, that the character of this wild and savage race could have been so readily
tamed and that their manners and lives could in so short a space of time have
been subjected to so decided a reform. Proceeding thus rapidly from the
enlistment and marching about the country which might be considered as the
first shadow of a drill, a result was accomplished through prudence,
perseverance and courage, which many might have wished for, but very few
anticipated


Immediately after the review the greater part of the corps was marched
offin detachments to relieve, as far as their numerical strength would admit,
the unhealthy outposts on the frontiers of the province, and the troops of the
line were withdrawn into Camp.


By continual residence among the Colonies, by unwearied attention to their
wants, wishes and peculiarities, and by kind and liberal treatment, the
affections of the race were entirely gained, and the word of the Agent was
received as law. Hespectiiii: him as a protector and benefactor as well as a just
arbitratoi and judge, every real or imaginary wrong was submitted to his
decision; to him the Bheel turned for advice and assistance whenever advice
and assistance could be of any use; greater obedience was rendered than had
been ever paid to the hereditary Naick, and duties which were not faithfully
and earnestly discharged, if not voluntarily performed, were rigidly enforced.

Translation of a howl granted
To, Bheel, of the Village of
Purguiina.

You have lived in the hills and plundered the
roads and country of the Sirkar, and committed thefts
and various crimes, now you are present and have
petitioned the Sirkar that, if pardoned you will not again
offend, and that if Tuecavee be given to you, you will
cultivate and thus earn a subsistence; on this, your prayer
has been considered and the Sirkar has shewn favor to
you, and has this once pardoned your past crimes and has
given you for your support Tuecavee and land to cultivate,
and this Kowl is written and presented to you that
you may remain in your Village and cultivate and thus
gain your livelihood. After this if you again commit any
otfence, your former crimes will not be considered as
forgiven but you will have to answer both them and tlie
new crime.

  to the terms of the amnesty,
a written kowl to the effect
quoted in the margin, was
presented to each individual,
which served as a pass of
security when absent from his
Village, and which was
expected to be kept always
near his person. In this
document it was freely written
and explained, that although
pardon was granted for all
past offence, yet any
future infringement of the
peace would involve a
forfeiture of the protection, and

mat the penalty tor the past as well as for present misdeeds would be
exacted from the offender.


But a happy change was fast progressing in the habits and ideas of the
race; few who took the Kowl ever violated their engagements and when call
ed upon to apprehend marauders or to trace the perpetrators of crime the
most ready and valuable assistance was ever rendered to the Police and' the
bulk of the people being thus favorably inclined to order, the refractory
Naicks were forced into submission, and an arrangement for the regular nav
ment of a certain sum of money was at length satisfactorily effected in lieu
of their hucks which had been heretofore received in kind from every vil
lage of the district. J

of Government in thus forming the Bheels into a corps. They were told at
one time by the evil disposed, that the object was to link them in a
line like galley slaves, and then to extirpate the race, that their blood
was in high demand as medicine in the country of their foreign
masters, and that assemblage in the corps would be speedily followed by
massacre as of yore; numbers in consequence of these idle and mischievous
rumours after having with the utmost exertions been induced to enter the
service, absconded in terror, and confidence was alone ultimately regained when
permanent dwellings were commenced at the Head Quarters and when lapse
of time evinced the groundless nature of their fears.


Villages were still occasionally plundered and gangs remained in arms
among the Hills, but suspicion had been thoroughly instilled among the
heads and leaders of the tribe; the summons for Black Mail was unheeded by
the villagers, aud the information of private haunts and fastnesses which was
now in the possession of the local authorities enabled the military forces to act
among the hills with some chance of success.


The system of reformation continued with unabated vigour in the Colonies,
and at the close of the year 18*26 upwards of three hundred ploughs had been
established. Time and patience and considerable persuasion were of course
necessary to induce the Bheels to undertake agricultural pursuits, and to
place the Colonies on a regular footing; bu*. the wild material was fast
accumulating, and the hereditary watchmen were gradually returning from the
hills to their villages.


Increased to three hundred men, the corps was now drilling at Head
Quarters, and in the commencement of the second season of their service, the
first opportunity was afforded to the reformed Bheels of Khandesh of shedding
their blood for their new masters; they freely risked their lives, and although
opposed by their own caste and relations, fought boldly for the Government.
The village of Boorwarree had been attacked and plundered, and emissaries
from the gang were passing rapidly among the hills to collect the disaffected,
when a small detachment of the Bheel Corps arrived at sunset on the spot.
Dashing immediately into the hills, Captain Outram arrived, after a tedious
night's march, on the eminence where the gang had retired, when he was
immediately assailed by showers of arrows and stones, a Jemedar and many
of the recruits were wounded, but the men fought on steadily and the enemy
was eventually driven from the commanding position it had occupied.


Fatigued however with the night march and the severe exertion of
following the gang from hill to hill, a retreat was feigned by Captain Outram's
gallant little band, and the enemy being by this ruse deluded with the idea
of victory, and drawn down upon the open plain, were charged and dispersed
at the point of the bayonet, the plunder of the village was recovered, arms
and other property secured, the marauding chief and many of his followers
killed in the action, and the gang entirely dispersed.


After this demonstration, the Corps rapidly increased; and during the rains
of 1827 six hundred rank and file were kept steadily at drill; the huts and
pendalls were completed at Dhurrungaon; the life of comparative ease and
comfort was highly relished, and, the draft from the regulars consisting only,
of men of high caste and character, the association inspired the Bheels with
a great degree of respect for themselves.


The feelings as well as the persons of the tribe were enlisted into the
service, their evil passions were at first tolerated to control and lead them to the
desired end, confidence was at length obtained in their suspicious minds, and
admiration of their officers ensured by a display of superiority in those very
qualities they most prided in themselves. Their sympathies and feelings
were also studied and cultivated, their improvement in heart and spirit closely
looked after, and that stability of connexion between the chief and his

A detachment of the Local Regiment arrives in time to repel an attack on

the town of Molair, and shortly after Lieutenant Outram surprises and

disperses the insurgents and recovers a great part of the plunder
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 7 -->

The Head Quarters of the Bheel Corps were ordered to be stationed at
Dhurrungaon. The pay of the men was fixed at five Rupees a month with an
additional Rupee as batta when on outpost duty, clothing was to be
furnished by Government, and armed with fusils the levy was to be drilled as
Light Infantry.


At first much duty was not to be expected, but the men were to be
employed in such a manner as would teach them obedience to orders, the very
essence of future duty, and the only antidote to their loose and irregular
habits.


Attention was also to be paid to their personal appearance, whereby more
favorable impressions would be excited in respect to themselves, and for the
same reason, punishments of a personal nature were to be avoided, and
dismissal from the corps for serious offences might be made with advantage,
previous to the offender being handed over to the Civil power.


The main features therefore in this theory of reformation were the awarding
strict justice to an oppressed race, the overthrow of the patriarchal authority of
the Naicks, and the substitution in their stead of a European Chief who should
be equally respected and obeyed, and whose commands and precepts would
prove of a very different nature to those which had heretofore emanated among
the hills, the conciliatory character and talent of the officers to be
employed, the judicious selection for the new Military body of the wild unruly
spirits who disdained the toil of honest labour, and the settlement among
colo■nies of the more staid among the society, the provision of a comfortable
maintenance for every one, the re-establishment of the ancient Village Bheel
Police, and above all the mild and liberal, though firm spirit of the existing
administration which encouraged with generous assistance the well disposed,
exercised a wholesome control over the evil doers, and whose measures under
{empty}.he new arrangement were equally certain of being promulgated and enforced
'by unbiassed servants.


Military operations were now reduced to the more feasible scale of
harassring the armed bands among the hills, and of allowing them little rest in any
one locality, and a general amnesty was offered to the tribe, with the
exception of the most heinous offenders, for whose apprehension large rewards were
proclaimed. Fatigued and worn out by the hardships of their miserable
situation and finding the spoil of the low country becoming daily more fruitless
and inaccessible, after a lengthy negociation, a few of the principal Naicks
■were with difficulty induced to take advantage of the humane offers of
Go•vernment, whilst others of the desperadoes were betrayed among their
immediate places of refuge.


A free pardon was granted for all past crimes to those who surrendered at
discretion, waste lands were allotted rent free for a term of twenty yeais,
wherever the Naicks and their followers proposed to settle, and an ample
{empty}.grant of money for clothes and subsistence, together with animals and
implements of cultivation were allowed during the period when the rude
husbandman was under proper instruction to make the earth yield up her treasures
-for his own support.


This grant was however to be received not as a free gift, but as an advance
to be hereafter recovered, should circumstances permit, and as the money was
judiciously expended under the immediate superintendence of the Agent, and
never intrusted to the improvident squandering of the Bheel, the advantages
were sufficiently apparent, and a most powerful check was thus placed upon
the present, and a strong hold was obtained over future indolence and
licentiousness. The greatest difficulties were, however, experienced in settling to
peaceable pursuits these wild intractable characters, in breaking through their
prejudices against labor, and in eradicating their propensities to plunder and
debauchery. The rude and half savage race moreover viewed with

nature of the country, the rapid movements of the Bheels, and the
assis

As the Beel settlements came into operation the Regulars were gradually
reduced as well as the Irregular Horse and extra Mahal Seebundees, and the
whole of the Troops of the Line were recalled to Malligaon and their posts
made over to detachments of the Bheel Corps.

The followino-statement shews the present distribution of the detachments of
-the Bheel Corps as well of the parties of Irregular Horse in the
undermentioned Talookas.—

Thus it appears that since the Bheel settlement has been completed, a
reduction of 2 European Officers and 220 Regulars of all ranks with their
field equipments has been effected, 85 Mahal Seebundees have returned to
their Districts, and the services of 71 Irregular Horse have been dispensed
with, the protection of the country being now entrusted to one hundred and
three reformed Bheels of the Bheel Corps, and to the reformed Naicks and
Bheels now settled iu the different districts and villages.

In like manner all other outposts held by regular troops throughout
Khandesh, have been relieved by parties of the Bheel corps with the
exception of the Head Quarter Station of Dhoolia.


The Southern Agency is purposely taken as a specimen containing the
only districts of the province where the original plan of Government has
been fully carried through, and where the system has been really
introduced and allowed to have fair play.

It was a matter of astonishment to behold the rapid change produced by the
liberal system of Government, in a race of miserable beings, who withont a
rag to cover their backs, and hardly a morsel of food to put into their mouths,
had so shortly before sued for life and food from the foreigner, and were
now fat and sleek and decently clad, living in their own huts, surrounded
by swarms of healthy children, ploughing their own lands, and many
in the honest possession of flocks and herds.


The principles upon which the Bheel corps was raised, were equally simple
at.d unquestionable; to secure the enlistment of chiefs, their relations or
members of their clans, to enforce the progressive advancement of all, through the
intermediate grades of private and non-Commissioned Officer, to regulate the
reins of discipline with a delicate and judicious hand, and to observe a just
and proper distribution of punishment and reward.


On these sure principles the Corps soon contained within itself such a
number of influential persons, connected or intimately acquainted with every
Chief or tribe of importance in Khandesh, that provided a Bheel culprit
remained in the province, his name and village only being sent to the
Commandant of the corps, apprehension followed nearly to a certainty.


Five years had hardly elapsed from the day when the first wild recruit was
enrolled in the service, and when the sword of the mountain cateran was first
exchanged for the ploughshare, but during that period the spirit of affairs had
undergone a happy change, and the country enjoved repose.


For years Khandeish had been subjected to utter misery and relentless
spoliation from the organized gang and the tyrannical Bheel chief, but the
generosity of Government, and the anxiety and exertion of its Agents
were now amply repaid in the complete success of a system, which had
thus restored peace and quiet.

{empty}. To show the confidence that had been restored throughout the country, the
recital of the following fact may not be considered unworthy of notice. In
a village near the Saat-poora range a petty theft had been committed by a
few boys, who carried off the cooking utensils from two houses; the Patell
and other inhabitants who suffered were asked how it happened that such
articles were taken from their houses without awakening them, and the
gratifying answer was received, "That since the Government settlement had
\"been made, no one in the village ever thought of fastening up their
nous" es at night considering themselves in perfect security".


The same character existed, the evil propensities could not be as yet totally
eradicated, but the wise measures in force had corrected the one and checked
the other, gang robberies had ceased for a period of 12 months and there
existed not in the Province one single leader of marauders.


The conduct of the corps was deserving of the warmest praise, and its
services were actively and continually employed in opposing on outpost a
front for the purpose of checking foreign aggression, or in the pursuit of
foreign marauders. When called upon, the men had invariably shown a
willingness, and readiness to act against friend and relation, and were ever on
the alert to obey the commands of their Officers, whilst the gradual
introduction of regular discipline had been applied to the root of the evil, and their
wild and lawless habits had been completely corrected.


The vice of intoxication had been thoroughly overcome, not even the most
trifling complaint against any one member of the corps had been made to the
authorities, and Government had thus obtained the services and labor of a
body of men, which had so long troubled the repose of the former, as well
as the present administration; to such lengths indeed were the excesses
carried, that the Poona Government looked alone to the extermination of the
Race for repose, whereas the present, by its reformation, had added a strength
to the executive power which few could have anticipated.

the idea of leaving their immediate homes, are somewhat more inclined to
agriculture than others of this roving class, but in the times of disorder they
frequently accompanied the Pindarees during plundering excursions, and
gained a name for licentiousness fully equal to that of their allies.—The fairer
complexion and finer feature of the Turrees may be traced to the
Mahomedan colonists, whom the Mogul policy had located among the hills.


Immediately in the neighbourhood of the Turrees are a savage set o£
beings termed " Nahals," who exist perfectly wild among the mountains,
subsisting chiefly on roots, fruits and berries; they court no intercourse with
others, and dwell in the unrestrained freedom and hardship of an utter savage
existence. Marriage contracts as well as all other religious ceremonies, are
entirely dispensed with, and the assorted pair are free to live together whilst
they choose, or separate at pleasure and convenience; the infant accompanies
its mother to her next abode, but the grown up children remain with the
father. The Nahals are dark and diminutive in statue, and their features
are exceedingly ill favored. A few of this tribe cultivate a little grain among
the ashes of the burnt boughs of the forest, or barter the produce of their
jungles for cloth, but they are very seldom to be met with beyond the
immediate bounds of their unhealthy location..


Another race of Mahomedan Bheels termed" Hirdhi," reside about the
Ajunta range in the Pergunnas of Jamuair and Burgaon; the intervening
distanee alone prevents their intermarriage with the "Turrees," for their
creed and ideas are similar; they are however of a discontented and
quarrelsome disposition, difficult to manage, and still more ferocious than their
brethren to the Eastward, and during seasons of disturbance,, the most
atrocious acts have been invariably ascribed to their prowess.


The common Khandesh Bheels who are scattered in such numbers
throughout the province, reject however all distinguishing name of clan o*
easte, and glory in the simple appellation of " Bheel." Indolent, dissipated
and singularly improvident, they consider themselves the highest of their
tribe, and although they condescend to receive food from the hands of those
who have degraded themselves by honest labour, yet they will not intermarry
with those who have thus sunk in their estimation. To barter any thing but
what was reaped by the hand of violence, was an offence against the tribe;
to cultivate or engage in mechanical craft, deeply degrading; and no
employment was considered to be correct, which in any way interfered with the
cherished burden of the long bow, and the ponderous sheaf of arrows. Local
situation in some instances, and in others, the gallant bearing of a powerful
chief, have bestowed the name on the few seceders from the nation.


The " Mutwarree" the " Burda" and the " Dorepie," inhabit the
mountainous range to the Northwest about Akrany and Dhergong, and became
despised on account of their skill in- basket-weaving and cultivation. The
term '• Khoteel" is generally applied to all the wild inhabitants of the
Saat-pooras, who barter gums and wax for the produce of the plains, and that
of " Daungchee" to all the natives of the Daung, who live below the
western ghauts. These latter are the most uncivilized of all the wild tribe*,
with intellect barely sufficient to understand and totally unequal to
comprehend any thing beyond tbe most simple communication; and with forms
stunted by the hardships, the noxious climate and the bitter poverty in which
they are steeped, it cannot be a matter of surprise, that among a set of such
degraded beings the principles of right and wrong.are entirely lost; the fear of
consequences overwhelmed in a blind reliance on their fortune;. the dread of
treachery, the predominant idea; and the animal instinct alone remaining in
full force, to urge the supply of theip daily wants.


Superstitious in the extreme, and possessing little attachment to fixed
spots, their temporary villages are removed on the occurrence of any evil
omen; freely addicted to intoxication, their evil propensities burst into a
